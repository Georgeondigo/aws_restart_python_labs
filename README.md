# AWS re/Start Python Labs

Welcome to my AWS re/Start Python Labs repository. This collection of scripts and data files represents my work and progress in learning Python as part of the AWS re/Start program.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains various Python scripts and related data files used in different exercises and projects during the AWS re/Start program. Below is a brief description of each file:

### Python Scripts

- **`analyze-insulin.py`**: Analyzes insulin sequences provided in text files.
- **`categorize-values.py`**: Categorizes values from data sets based on specific criteria.
- **`collections1.py`**: Demonstrates basic operations with Python collections such as lists, dictionaries, and sets.
- **`composite-data.py`**: Works with composite data types in Python, such as tuples and dictionaries.
- **`conditionals.py`**: Explores conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`) and their usage.
- **`for-loop.py`**: Demonstrates the use of `for` loops in Python for iteration.
- **`hello-world.py`**: A simple script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console, often the first program written when learning a new language.
- **`numeric-data.py`**: Manipulates and analyzes numeric data types in Python.
- **`string-data-type.py`**: Works with strings and demonstrates common string operations in Python.
- **`string-insulin.py`**: A script focused on handling and processing string data related to insulin sequences.
- **`while-loop.py`**: Demonstrates the use of `while` loops in Python for repeated execution based on a condition.

### Data Files

- **`car_fleet.csv`**: A CSV file containing data about a car fleet, used for data analysis exercises.
- **`ainsulin-seq-clean.txt`, `binsulin-seq-clean.txt`, `cinsulin-seq-clean.txt`, `lsinsulin-seq-clean.txt`**: Text files containing cleaned sequences of insulin.
- **`preproinsulin-seq-clean.txt`, `preproinsulin-seq.txt`**: Text files with sequences related to preproinsulin, used for analysis in the `analyze-insulin.py` script.

## Getting Started

To run any of the Python scripts, you can clone the repository and execute the scripts using a Python interpreter. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Georgeondigo/aws-restart-python-labs.git
cd aws-restart-python-labs
python3 script_name.py
